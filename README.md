# Block-discrete-empirical-interpolation-methods

The codes are matlab implementations of the block variants of discrete empirical interpolation method. For more information about how the details of the algorithms  please see


From the above paper
```
MaxVol.m is the implementation of Algorithm 1.
block_deim_maxvol.m is the implementation of Algorithm 3.
block_deim_qr.m is the implementation of Algorithm 4.
adap_blk_qr.m and adap_blk_maxvol.m are the implementations of Algorithm 5.
